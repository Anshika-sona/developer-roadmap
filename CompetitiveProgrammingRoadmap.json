<ResourceGroupTitle> Competitive Coding </ResourceGroupTitle>

    Competitive Coding is nothing but a great way to learn programming by solving different sets of problems. 
    Long story short, you will receive some problems/situations in programming which you will solve by programming.


1. Choose a programming language:
    Well first thing first, you need a language to learn. 
    You need to learn its fundamentals and most important its data types, looping, playing with conditions, solve some pattern-related problems.


2. Learn Data Structures:
    The best way to learn them is by practicing them, most important is to understand why we need them and how to use them.
    a. Array
    b. Queue
    c. Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List
    d. Tree
    e. Heap
    f. Graph


 3. Calculate Time and Space complexity:
    The most important thing in Competitive Coding is to calculate space and time complexity. 

 4. Get Started With Algorithms:
    Basic Algorithms:
    If you are here, it means you are confident enough to know why algorithms is important.

    So, Let’s list out some basic algorithms first:

a. Searching:

— Depth First Searching

— Breath First Searching

b. Sorting:

— Merge Sorting

— Quick Sorting

— Bucket Sorting

— Heap Sorting

— Insertion sort etc.

c. Hashing

d. 2 pointers

e. Backtracking

Intermediate Algorithms:
Greedy Algo
Dynamic Programming
Graph DSA
Advanced Algorithms:
Game Theory
Advanced String Algorithms
Types of Trees
Set Theory etc.
