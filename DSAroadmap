* ✏️ Practice
    Now that we have finished going over fundamentals of the most important Data Structure and Algorithms, it is time for us to pull those concepts into practice and give each one a short.

* 📈 Become a pro by competing
    Now is the time to put your knowledge and effectiveness to the test. The most effective strategy is to compete against other people to see where exactly stand-out and to further improvise.
